With the work done by [Don Williamson](http://donw.io/post/github-comments/ "Replacing Disqus with Github Comments") and [Dave Compton](https://dc25.github.io/myBlog/2017/06/24/using-github-comments-in-a-jekyll-blog.html "Using Github comments in a Jekyll blog") it was pretty easy to enable comments on my blog.
They implemented a solution build on the Github Issue API to manage comments and I really liked that idea. The benefits are nicely summarized in the blog post by Don.
So I followed the steps mentioned in Dave's blog post and here we are, comments enabled!
